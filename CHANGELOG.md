    *   **Logging & Error Handling Improvements:** Increased logging detail and improved error handling throughout the application. (Ongoing, with notable contributions from commits `0919b581`, `a51ec07b`, `f268692e` on May 8)

## II. Core Analysis Pipeline: Architectural and Algorithmic Enhancements

### A. Advanced Component Detection (YOLO-based)

#### 1. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) Logic Enhancement
*   **Previous State:** The YOLO object detection stage could yield multiple, overlapping bounding boxes for a single component. Standard NMS, relying solely on Intersection over Union (IoU), did not always select the most confident detection.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** The NMS algorithm was modified to incorporate **confidence scores** as a primary sorting and filtering criterion, alongside IoU. This ensures that bounding boxes with higher detection confidence are prioritized, leading to a significant reduction in redundant detections and an increase in the precision of component localization. (Tracked in commit `714d293d`)

#### 2. Dynamic Bounding Box Coordinate Adjustment Post-Cropping
*   **Challenge:** If image cropping (e.g., via SAM2) occurred after YOLO detection, the absolute bounding box coordinates from YOLO would become misaligned with the new, smaller image dimensions, corrupting component localization for downstream processes.
*   **Solution:** Implemented a coordinate transformation module. This module dynamically recalculates YOLO bounding box coordinates relative to the origin and dimensions of the cropped `image_for_analysis`. This ensures that component locations remain accurate even after SAM2-based intelligent cropping, preserving data integrity for subsequent analysis stages like node detection and value extraction.

### B. SAM2 for High-Fidelity Segmentation & Intelligent Cropping

#### 1. Transition to Instance Segmentation with SAM2
*   **Previous State:** The system utilized global image analysis or less sophisticated segmentation methods, which often struggled to accurately isolate the main circuit board from complex backgrounds or surrounding visual noise.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** Integrated the **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)** (Hiera Large variant) for high-fidelity instance segmentation. The integration involved:
    *   Adding `sam2` (via git repository) and `peft` dependencies.
    *   Implementing SAM2 model loading in `CircuitAnalyzer` via a helper function (`get_modified_sam2` in `sam2_infer.py`). This process loads the base SAM2 architecture and weights (`sam2.1_hiera_l.yaml`, `sam2.1_hiera_large.pt`).
    *   Applying Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using LoRA (rank 4, alpha 16) to specific transformer layers within the SAM2 model, allowing adaptation without retraining the entire model.
    *   Utilizing a custom wrapper (`SAM2ImageWrapper`) around the PEFT-modified model. This wrapper incorporates trainable prompt embeddings, enabling image-only segmentation inference suitable for this application.
    *   Loading separately trained fine-tuned weights (`best_miou_model_SAM_latest.pth`) into the final wrapped/PEFT model structure.
    *   Implementing a `segment_with_sam2` method in `CircuitAnalyzer` that leverages `SAM2Transforms` for image preprocessing (Resize, Normalize) and mask postprocessing (Interpolation to original size, Thresholding to binary).
    *   Integrating the `segment_with_sam2` call into the `get_node_connections` workflow, using the resulting binary mask as the precise input for subsequent steps like component area removal and contour finding.
    This shift to SAM2 provides a much cleaner and more accurate delineation of conductive paths compared to previous segmentation methods. (Refer to merge `83a49854` and related `V2_SAM` branch commits)

#### 2. Intelligent Cropping Workflow Based on SAM2 Masks
*   **Previous State:** Analysis was conducted on the entire uploaded image, leading to unnecessary computational load on irrelevant background areas and potentially impacting the accuracy of localized feature detection due to scale and noise.
*   **Implemented Workflow:**
    1.  An initial SAM2 segmentation is performed on the full image to determine the extent of the main circuit components.
    2.  The system then **intelligently crops both the visual image and the SAM2 segmentation mask** based on this identified extent, with configurable padding added to ensure no relevant parts are cut off. (Commits: `85f64fca`, `79e6c102`, `dbc0a945`)
    3.  YOLO bounding box coordinates are dynamically adjusted to the new cropped image dimensions. All subsequent analyses (node detection, value extraction via Gemini using an enumerated version of the cropped image, etc.) are performed on this focused, cropped region, leading to improved processing speed and more accurate results.
    *   **Refinement for Text Preservation (Post May 8, 2025):** To specifically address instances where component values or other relevant text near the circuit were being inadvertently cropped, the logic within `crop_image_and_adjust_bboxes` in `src/circuit_analyzer.py` was further enhanced:
        *   **Dynamic Skip for Focused Images:** If the initial `sam_extent_bbox` (the area identified by SAM2 as containing the circuit) already covers a large percentage (e.g., >75%) of the total image, the system now bypasses the cropping step. This preserves the original view when the image is already tightly focused on the circuit and its immediate surroundings.
        *   **Text-Aware Window Expansion:** When cropping does occur, the system iterates through all bounding boxes identified by the YOLO model as belonging to the `'text'` class. If such text boxes are located in proximity to the `sam_extent_bbox` (i.e., they overlap an area defined by the `sam_extent_bbox` expanded by the general `padding` value), the calculated crop window is dynamically expanded. This expansion ensures these text elements are fully included, with an additional specific `text_inclusion_padding` (e.g., 15 pixels) applied around them to prevent any clipping. This ensures critical textual information is retained alongside the cropped circuit.

#### 3. Fallback Strategy for SAM2 Unavailability
*   **Challenge:** If the SAM2 models were not configured, missing, or failed to load, the system could either fail or produce degraded results due to dependencies on segmentation.
*   **Resilience Mechanism:** Implemented a conditional check for SAM2 model availability and successful initialization. If SAM2 cannot be utilized, the system gracefully **reverts to using the original, uncropped image** for the entire analysis pipeline, ensuring operational continuity, albeit without the benefits of intelligent cropping.

### C. Enhancements in Node Analysis and Connectivity Mapping

#### 1. SAM2 Mask-Guided Targeted Node Detection
*   **Previous State:** Node detection algorithms processed either the entire image or a crudely defined ROI, often including noise from component bodies or irrelevant background areas, which could reduce the accuracy of trace and connection identification.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** Node connection analysis now operates on a **refined input derived by processing the cropped SAM2 binary mask**. Specifically, a mask manipulation step is performed where areas occupied by detected components (using their adjusted YOLO bounding boxes on the cropped image) are "emptied" (subtracted) from the SAM2 mask. This ensures that node and trace analysis algorithms focus exclusively on the conductive paths, leading to more precise node identification and connection mapping.

#### 2. Overhaul of Corner Detection Algorithm
*   **Previous State:** The system predominantly used Harris corner detection for identifying potential node points. This method exhibited limitations with noisy images or certain circuit board textures, sometimes leading to missed or spurious detections.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** The Harris corner detection algorithm, along with its subsequent DBSCAN clustering of detected corners, was entirely removed from the node identification process. The logic for associating components with conductive paths (contours) was modified to directly check for proximity between a component's bounding box and any point along the entirety of a contour's path, rather than relying on a pre-computed sparse set of corner points. This change moves towards a more exhaustive pixel-level assessment of connectivity. (Tracked in commit `a62992d7` from `V2_SAM` branch)

#### 3. Fortification of Corner Detection Robustness in `CircuitAnalyzer`
*   **Challenge:** Edge cases in coordinate data (e.g., empty sets after filtering) or failures in clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN not finding clusters) could lead to runtime errors or suboptimal node localization.
*   **Implemented Safeguards (within `CircuitAnalyzer`):**
    *   **Pre-emptive Data Validation:** Added checks for empty coordinate sets before attempting scaling or clustering operations, preventing runtime errors.
    *   **Clustering Fallback:** Implemented a fallback mechanism: if the density-based clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) fails to produce a valid result (e.g., no clusters found, or all points classified as noise), the system utilizes the original, unclustered corner points. This ensures that the analysis can proceed even if clustering is not optimal.
    *   **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Incorporated more descriptive warning messages during the corner detection phase to facilitate debugging of complex or problematic images. (Tracked in commit `db0e3d05`)

### D. Netlist Generation and AI-Powered Value Extraction (Multi-Stage AI Process)

The generation of the final, usable netlist involves a sophisticated multi-stage process, leveraging different AI models for specific tasks, significantly enhanced by the changes in commit `orin`. The `editable_netlist_content` session state variable was also introduced in commit `orin` to store the current netlist text as it evolves through these stages, serving as the primary source for UI display and subsequent SPICE analysis.

#### 1. Stage 1: LLaMA-Powered Semantic Direction Enrichment (Commit `orin`)
*   **Purpose:** To automatically determine the semantic orientation of directional components (e.g., anode/cathode for diodes, positive/negative terminals for polarized capacitors or sources) *before* full netlist generation. This helps in creating a more accurate initial netlist, especially regarding the order of connection nodes.
*   **Technical Implementation (Commit `orin`):**
    *   **Timing:** This step occurs after the initial YOLO component detection and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), but *before* SAM2-based intelligent cropping. It operates on the `bboxes_orig_coords_nms` (bounding boxes in original image coordinates).
    *   **Mechanism:** The `analyzer._enrich_bboxes_with_directions` method is called. This method internally uses a LLaMA model (accessed via the Groq API client) to analyze image patches corresponding to each detected component.
    *   **Output:** The LLaMA model provides a `semantic_direction` (e.g., "LEFT_TO_RIGHT", "TOP_TO_BOTTOM", "ANODE_LEFT", "CATHODE_RIGHT") which is then added as an attribute to the respective bounding box dictionary.
    *   **Preservation:** This `semantic_direction` attribute is preserved through subsequent deep copies and adjustments of bounding boxes if/when image cropping occurs.
    *   **Utilization:** The `generate_netlist_from_nodes` function in `CircuitAnalyzer` utilizes this `semantic_direction` to infer the correct order of `node_1` and `node_2` for directional components when constructing the initial netlist. The resulting text of this netlist (valueless but with LLaMA-informed directions) is the first content to populate `st.session_state.editable_netlist_content`.
    *   **Comparison Netlist:** For debugging and assessing the impact of LLaMA directions, a separate version of the initial netlist is generated *without* applying these semantic directions (`valueless_netlist_text_no_llama_dir`).
*   **Fallback:** If the LLaMA enrichment step fails or the Groq client is unavailable (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY` missing or `analyzer.groq_client` is not properly initialized), the system logs a warning and proceeds without semantic directions. In this case, the netlist generation relies on default node ordering.

#### 2. Stage 2: Gemini-Powered Component Value and Type Extraction (VLM)
*   **Previous State (Value Extraction):** Component values were often not extracted, or the system relied on rudimentary OCR or template matching, which resulted in frequent omissions or inaccuracies in the final netlist.
*   **Technical Enhancement (Multi-Stage Process):**
    *   **Foundation & Initial API Integration (Commit `eeca9ac8`):** The groundwork for AI-powered value extraction was laid. This involved:
        *   Establishing the project structure by moving core modules into a `src` package.
        *   Integrating the `google-genai` library (replacing `google-generativeai`).
        *   Implementing the initial `gemini_labels` utility function using the updated `google-genai` SDK (client initialization, `client.models.generate_content` call, newer model specification `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`, and configuration). This provided the basic capability to send an enumerated image to Gemini and receive component information.
    *   **Prompt Optimization & Endpoint Update (Commit `9b321d16`, potentially others):** The process was refined further:
        *   The prompt sent to the Gemini model was significantly optimized for better accuracy and structured JSON output (tracked in `9b321d16`).
        *   An alternative endpoint via OpenRouter (`gemini_labels_openrouter`) was added (likely via merge `83a49854` or related commits), providing flexibility.
    *   **Integrated Workflow:** The full multi-stage process was established, involving:
        1.  Generating an initial "valueless" netlist based on geometric analysis **and LLaMA-derived semantic directions (Stage 1)**.
        2.  Creating an enumerated version of the (potentially cropped) analysis image (`enum_img`).
        3.  Submitting this `enum_img` to the selected Gemini endpoint (`gemini_labels_openrouter` as per commit `orin`'s `app.py` changes) using the optimized prompt.
        4.  Parsing the structured JSON response from Gemini. The raw response from the VLM is stored in `st.session_state.active_results['vlm_stage2_output']` for debugging purposes (introduced in commit `orin`).
        5.  Enriching the initial netlist with the extracted component types and values (using `analyzer.fix_netlist` which correlates results via component IDs/UIDs). The `st.session_state.editable_netlist_content` is then updated with the text of this new, value-enriched netlist.

#### 3. Stage 3: Netlist Data Refinement and Validation
*   **Challenge:** The raw netlist, even after Gemini enrichment, could contain entries with `None` for values, or exhibit improperly formatted lines for specific component types (e.g., current sources lacking complete node connection data).
*   **Solution:** Implemented robust correlation, filtering, and validation logic:
    *   **Correlation & Initial Fixes (Commit `57d5db22` from V2_SAM):** The `fix_netlist` function was significantly enhanced to correlate Gemini's output (based on visual IDs) with the geometrically derived netlist components (using `persistent_uid` via the enumerated bounding boxes). This commit implemented the core logic for updating component `value` (if initially None), correcting `class` based on Gemini's identification, recalculating `component_num` upon class change, and specifically handling ground (`gnd`) connections by setting `node_2` to 0 and adjusting string formatting.
    *   **Independent Source Value Validation (Commit `681df4da`):** Added specific checks within `fix_netlist` to invalidate (set to `None`) values provided by Gemini for independent voltage or current sources if the value was non-numeric (e.g., an alphabetical variable name where a number was expected).
    *   **Final Null Value Filtering (Commit `12dce171`):** Implemented a post-processing step in `app.py` *after* `fix_netlist` to explicitly remove any remaining lines from the netlist where the component `value` was `None` or the string `"None"`, ensuring a cleaner final output.
    These refinements result in a more accurate and SPICE-compatible netlist. (Commits: `12dce171`, `681df4da`, `57d5db22`)

## III. User Interface (UI), Visualization, and Workflow Enhancements

### A. Streamlined, Event-Driven Workflow Automation
*   **Previous State:** The workflow required users to upload a file and then manually initiate the analysis via a "Start Analysis" button.
*   **Technical Enhancement:** The system was re-architected to **auto-trigger the entire analysis pipeline immediately upon successful file upload**. This was achieved by implementing an event listener or callback mechanism tied to the file upload completion event. The manual "Start Analysis" button was removed, simplifying user interaction and accelerating the workflow. A custom loading animation provides real-time visual feedback during the processing stages. (Tracked in commit `e6aeebcf`)

### B. Enhanced Results Visualization and Data Presentation
*   **Detailed Performance Metrics:** The UI now renders detailed timings for each major stage of the analysis pipeline (e.g., YOLO, SAM2 Segmentation, Cropping, Node Analysis, Netlist Generation), offering insights into performance characteristics.
*   **Comprehensive Image Details & EXIF Data Handling:**
    *   The original uploaded image is displayed alongside its fundamental properties (dimensions, format, color mode, filename).
    *   **EXIF Data Integration & Processing:**
        *   **Challenge:** Ignored EXIF metadata, especially the `Orientation` tag, could lead to images being processed in an incorrect orientation, affecting analysis accuracy.
        *   **Solution:** Integrated an EXIF parsing library. The system now extracts and displays key EXIF tags, including `Orientation` and `Software`. Crucially, images are **automatically rotated to their correct upright orientation** based on the EXIF `Orientation` tag *before* any analysis is performed. This image normalization step ensures consistency and accuracy for all subsequent processing. (Tracked in commit `a1d51443`)
*   **Component Detection Visualization:** An annotated version of the (cropped) `image_for_analysis` is displayed, featuring bounding boxes around all detected components. Component statistics, including counts and average confidence scores per type, are also presented.
*   **Node Analysis Visualization Suite:**
    *   The final node connection graph/visualization is rendered.
    *   The SAM2 segmentation output (typically a colored instance mask) is displayed, allowing verification of the segmentation quality.
    *   An expandable UI section provides access to **intermediate debug images** from the node analysis module. This includes the "Emptied Mask" (the SAM2 mask after component areas have been removed), the "Enhanced Mask" (potentially after morphological operations), and the "Contour Image" (used for trace finding).
*   **Comparative Netlist Display:** The UI presents the **initial netlist (informed by LLaMA semantic directions from Stage 1 of netlist generation)** and the **final, value-enriched netlist (after VLM Stage 2 processing)** side-by-side, using `st.code` with "verilog" language highlighting. This allows users to track the netlist evolution from its initial structural form to the final, analyzable version.
*   **LLaMA Semantic Direction Debug (Commit `orin`):** A new expander titled "↗️ Debug: LLaMA Directions" was added within the "Component Detection" column. It displays a table of components (from `st.session_state.active_results['bboxes']`, which are relative to `image_for_analysis`) with their `persistent_uid`, YOLO class, and the `semantic_direction` determined by the LLaMA model in Stage 1 of netlist generation. This aids in understanding how component orientations were inferred prior to node ordering in the initial netlist.
*   **Initial Netlist Comparison Debug (Commit `orin`):** An expander "🔍 Differences in Initial Netlists (LLaMA vs. No LLaMA)" was introduced under the main netlist display. If the LLaMA-directed initial netlist (`valueless_netlist_text`) differs from one generated without LLaMA directions (`valueless_netlist_text_no_llama_dir` - generated internally for this comparison), this section shows a line-by-line diff, helping assess the impact of the LLaMA Stage 1 enrichment.
*   **VLM Interaction Debug (Commit `orin` enhancement):** The expander for debugging the VLM stage (Stage 2 of netlist generation) was enhanced and titled "🔍 Debug: VLM". It now displays:
    *   The **enumerated image** (`enum_img` from `st.session_state.active_results`) that was dispatched to the VLM (Gemini) model for value and type extraction.
    *   The **raw VLM analysis output** (the list of dictionaries/JSON received from Gemini) stored in `st.session_state.active_results['vlm_stage2_output']`, formatted as a Python list of dicts using `st.code`. This provides direct insight into the VLM's response before it's parsed and integrated by `fix_netlist`.
*   General UI styling and layout improvements were implemented for a more intuitive and informative user experience.

### C. SPICE Analysis Integration
*   The SPICE simulation functionality remains available, now utilizing the higher-fidelity, value-enriched final netlist as its input.

## IV. System Process, Configuration, and Stability Improvements

### A. Refined and Sequential Analysis Pipeline Orchestration
*   **Previous State:** The sequence of analysis operations within the codebase (`app.py`) might have been less optimally ordered or harder to trace, potentially leading to inefficiencies or subtle data dependency issues. The final netlist, including AI-powered value extraction, was generated automatically in one sequence.
*   **Technical Restructuring:** The main application logic in `app.py` was refactored. The generation of the final, value-enriched netlist (which involves sending an enumerated image to the Gemini model for component type and value extraction) was separated from the initial automated analysis pipeline. This final enrichment step became a user-triggered action via a new 'Get Final Netlist' button, deferring the potentially time-consuming AI call. The automated pipeline now focuses on the following core sequence (Tracked in commit `c2bf78df`):
    1.  **Image Ingestion & Preparation:** Load the image, handle EXIF orientation (if applicable at this stage of development), and save a working copy.
    2.  **Initial Component Detection:** Perform YOLO detection on the original image, followed by confidence-based NMS.
    3.  **Node Analysis:** Conduct node analysis to determine connectivity. (The specifics of segmentation, e.g., SAM2 usage, would depend on its integration status prior to or within this commit, but this commit does not introduce the SAM2-based *extent cropping* or YOLO bounding box adjustment relative to such a crop).
    4.  **Initial Netlist Generation:** Generate the initial, "valueless" netlist from detected components and their geometrically inferred connections.
    5.  **Preparation for AI-Enrichment:** Create and store an enumerated version of the original image (displaying component IDs) to be used later if the user triggers the final netlist generation with Gemini.

### B. Enhanced Model and Asset Path Management
*   **Challenge:** Hardcoded or less flexible model paths could lead to deployment issues, particularly in containerized or diverse operating system environments. Docker configurations may not have been fully optimized.
*   **Improvements Implemented:**
    *   Increased the robustness of path handling for YOLO and SAM2 models. This included specific adjustments for Linux/Ubuntu environments, such as ensuring correct SAM2 configuration paths for frameworks like Hydra. (Tracked in commit `81989c85`)
    *   **Startup Integrity Checks:** Implemented checks during application startup for the presence of essential SAM2 model files. If files are not found, warnings are issued, and SAM2-dependent features are gracefully disabled, preventing application crashes due to missing assets.
    *   **Docker Optimization:** Updated and refined Docker configurations (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.) for improved build efficiency, smaller image sizes, better portability, and more reliable dependency management. (Commits: `2656fcb2`, `c48840df`)

### C. Comprehensive Logging and Error Handling Enhancements
*   **Previous State:** Logging was potentially sparse in certain modules, and error handling might have been too generic, complicating debugging and issue diagnosis. Handling of problematic input files (e.g., missing or corrupt images) could result in ungraceful application failures.
*   **Technical Improvements:**
    *   **Granular Logging:** Significantly increased the detail, scope, and consistency of logging across the application's lifecycle. This provides better traceability for the analysis process and aids in pinpointing issues.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implemented more specific and resilient error handling mechanisms, particularly during critical phases like model loading and intensive analysis steps.
    *   **Graceful Failure on Input Issues:** Improved the handling of edge cases related to input data, such as attempts to process missing or corrupt image files. The application now fails more gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user or logs.
    *   **Log Verbosity Reduction (Commit `orin`):** Suppressed verbose logging output from the `groq._base_client` by setting its log level to `WARNING`. This helps to reduce noise in the application logs, making it easier to find relevant information.
    *   **Log Message Clarification (Commit `orin`):** An existing logging message related to the automatic processing of example images was clarified. The message now more accurately reflects the condition where an example is not processed because the last processed item was an upload, even if the widget selection for the example itself did not change.
    *   *Note: The changes in commits `0919b581` ("caption"), `a51ec07b` ("classes"), and `f268692e` ("44") are understood to contribute to these overarching stability and refinement efforts. More specific technical details for these commits would require further code review.*
