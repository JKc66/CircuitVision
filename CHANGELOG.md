### Core Analysis Pipeline Enhancements:

*   **Advanced Component Detection (YOLO):**
    *   **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) Enhancement:**
        *   **Before:** The YOLO object detection might produce multiple, overlapping bounding boxes for the same component, potentially leading to redundant entries or misinterpretations in later stages. Standard NMS might have been based solely on Intersection over Union (IoU).
        *   **After:** Implemented **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) based on confidence scores** in addition to IoU. This method prioritizes bounding boxes with higher detection confidence, effectively filtering out weaker, redundant detections and significantly improving the precision of component identification. (Corresponds to commit `714d293d`)
    *   **Bounding Box Adjustment with SAM2 Cropping:**
        *   **Before:** If the image was cropped after YOLO detection, bounding box coordinates would not align with the new cropped image, leading to incorrect component localization for subsequent analysis.
        *   **After:** Implemented logic to **dynamically adjust YOLO bounding box coordinates** relative to the new image dimensions if SAM2-based intelligent cropping is applied. This ensures that component locations remain accurate on the cropped `image_for_analysis`.

*   **SAM2 Segmentation and Intelligent Cropping (Major Update):**
    *   **Segmentation Capability:**
        *   **Before:** The system relied primarily on global image analysis or less sophisticated segmentation techniques, which might not accurately isolate the main circuit board area from the background or surrounding clutter.
        *   **After:** Integrated the **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)** to perform detailed instance segmentation of the uploaded image. SAM2 is used to identify and delineate the primary circuit board area with high precision. (Corresponds to merge `83a49854` and related `V2_SAM` commits)
    *   **Intelligent Cropping Workflow:**
        *   **Before:** Analysis was performed on the entire uploaded image, potentially wasting computational resources on irrelevant background areas and sometimes reducing the accuracy of localized feature detection.
        *   **After:**
            1.  An initial SAM2 segmentation is performed on the full image to determine the extent of the main circuit components.
            2.  The system then **intelligently crops both the visual image and the SAM2 segmentation mask** based on this identified extent, with configurable padding added to ensure no relevant parts are cut off. (Corresponds to commits `85f64fca`, `79e6c102`, `dbc0a945`)
            3.  All subsequent analyses (node detection, value extraction, etc.) are performed on this focused, cropped region, leading to improved processing speed and more accurate results.
    *   **Fallback Mechanism:**
        *   **Before:** If a specialized segmentation model was intended but unavailable, the system might fail or produce poor results.
        *   **After:** If SAM2 models are configured but missing or fail to load, the system gracefully **falls back to using the original, uncropped image** for analysis, ensuring operational continuity.

*   **Node Analysis Improvements:**
    *   **Targeted Node Detection with SAM2 Mask:**
        *   **Before:** Node detection algorithms operated on the entire image or a more crudely defined region, potentially including noise from component bodies or irrelevant areas, reducing connection accuracy.
        *   **After:** Node connection analysis now operates on a **refined input derived from the cropped SAM2 binary mask**. Specifically, areas occupied by detected components (from YOLO) are "emptied" or removed from the mask. This ensures that node/trace analysis focuses solely on the conductive paths, leading to more precise node identification and connection mapping. This process uses the adjusted YOLO bounding boxes on the cropped image.
    *   **Corner Detection Algorithm Overhaul:**
        *   **Before:** The system primarily utilized Harris corner detection for identifying potential node points. This method sometimes struggled with noisy images or specific circuit board textures.
        *   **After:** Replaced Harris corner detection with a **custom pixel-based corner finding algorithm**. This new approach directly analyzes local pixel patterns to identify corners, offering improved robustness and accuracy across diverse image types and in the presence of noise. (Corresponds to commit `a62992d7` from `V2_SAM`)
    *   **Enhanced Corner Detection Robustness:**
        *   **Before:** Edge cases in coordinate data or clustering failures could lead to errors or suboptimal results.
        *   **After:** The `CircuitAnalyzer`'s corner detection process was further fortified with:
            *   Pre-emptive checks for empty coordinate sets before scaling operations, preventing runtime errors.
            *   A fallback mechanism to utilize the original, unclustered corner points if the density-based clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN) fails to produce a valid result, ensuring the analysis can proceed.
            *   More descriptive warning messages during the corner detection phase to aid in debugging complex cases. (Corresponds to commit `db0e3d05`)

*   **Netlist Generation & Value Extraction:**
    *   **Before (Value Extraction):** Component values were either not extracted or relied on simpler OCR/template matching methods, leading to frequent omissions or inaccuracies in the netlist.
    *   **After (Gemini-Powered Value Extraction):**
        *   Implemented a **two-stage netlist generation process**:
            1.  An initial "valueless" netlist is created based on geometric analysis of detected components and their interconnections.
            2.  An enumerated version of the (potentially cropped) analysis image is generated, where each component is clearly marked with a unique identifier.
            3.  This numbered image is then processed by a Gemini vision model (`gemini_labels_openrouter`) with an optimized prompt to accurately identify component types (e.g., Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, Diode, Transistor, IC) and their corresponding values (e.g., 10kÎ©, 100uF, 1N4001). (Corresponds to commits `eeca9ac8`, `9b321d16`)
            4.  The information extracted by Gemini is used to enrich the initial netlist, producing a comprehensive and accurate final netlist.
    *   **Netlist Refinement:**
        *   **Before:** The netlist could contain entries with missing values (`None`) or improperly formatted lines for certain component types (e.g., current sources missing node connections).
        *   **After:** Implemented robust filtering to remove any lines with `None` or invalid/incomplete values from the final netlist. Corrected parsing logic to ensure all component types, including current sources, are represented with all necessary node information. This ensures a cleaner, SPICE-compatible output. (Corresponds to commits `12dce171`, `681df4da`, `57d5db22`)

### User Interface (UI) & Visualization:

*   **Streamlined Workflow:**
    *   Analysis now **auto-triggers on file upload**, removing the need for a manual "Start Analysis" button.
    *   A custom loading animation is displayed during the analysis process.
    *   **Streamlined Workflow Automation:**
        *   **Before:** Users were required to upload a file and then manually click a "Start Analysis" button to initiate the processing pipeline.
        *   **After:** The analysis process now **auto-triggers immediately upon successful file upload**. The manual "Start Analysis" button has been removed, simplifying the user interaction and speeding up the workflow. A custom loading animation provides visual feedback to the user during the analysis. (Corresponds to commit `e6aeebcf`)

*   **Enhanced Results Display:**
    *   **Detailed Timings:** The UI now shows how long each major step of the analysis took (e.g., YOLO, SAM2 Segmentation, Cropping, Node Analysis, Netlist Generation).
    *   **Image Details & EXIF Data:**
        *   The original uploaded image is displayed alongside its basic properties (size, format, mode, name).
        *   **EXIF data** (if present) is extracted and displayed, including important tags like `Orientation` and `Software`.
        *   Images are **auto-rotated** based on their EXIF orientation tag before processing.
        *   **Image Details & EXIF Data Handling:**
            *   The original uploaded image is displayed alongside its basic properties (size, format, mode, name).
            *   **EXIF Data Integration:**
                *   **Before:** EXIF metadata, particularly orientation, might have been ignored, leading to images being processed in an incorrect orientation.
                *   **After:** EXIF data (if present) is extracted and displayed, including important tags like `Orientation` and `Software`. Images are now **automatically rotated to their correct orientation** based on the EXIF `Orientation` tag before any analysis is performed, ensuring consistency. (Corresponds to commit `a1d51443`)
    *   **Component Detection Visualization:**
        *   An annotated version of the (potentially cropped) `image_for_analysis` is shown with bounding boxes around detected components.
        *   **Component statistics** (count and average confidence per component type) are displayed.
    *   **Node Analysis Visualization:**
        *   The final node connection visualization is shown.
        *   The **SAM2 segmentation output** (colored mask) is displayed.
        *   An expander section provides **debug images** from the node analysis process, including the "Emptied Mask" (SAM2 mask after component removal), "Enhanced Mask", and "Contour Image".
    *   **Netlist Display:**
        *   Both the **initial (valueless) netlist** and the **final (Gemini-enriched) netlist** are displayed side-by-side for comparison.
    *   **Gemini Debug:** An expander shows the **enumerated image** that was sent to Gemini for value extraction.
    *   General styling and layout improvements for a cleaner and more informative interface.

*   **SPICE Analysis:**
    *   Remains available, using the final, value-enriched netlist.

### Process, Configuration, and Stability:

*   **Refined Analysis Pipeline Order:**
    *   **Before:** The sequence of analysis operations might have been less optimal or harder to follow within the codebase.
    *   **After:** The main application logic in `app.py` was restructured to follow a more clearly defined and logical sequence of operations (Corresponds to commit `c2bf78df`):
        1.  Load image, handle EXIF orientation, and save a working copy.
        2.  Perform YOLO detection on the original image, followed by confidence-based NMS.
        3.  Execute SAM2 segmentation on the original image to determine the primary circuit extent.
        4.  Crop the visual image and SAM2 mask based on this extent; dynamically adjust YOLO bounding box coordinates to the cropped image.
        5.  Store and prepare the annotated image (based on cropped and adjusted data) for display.
        6.  Conduct node analysis utilizing the cropped SAM2 mask (with component areas removed) and the adjusted YOLO bounding boxes.
        7.  Generate the initial, valueless netlist from detected components and connections.
        8.  Create an enumerated version of the cropped image, send it to the Gemini model for component type and value extraction, and then generate the final, value-enriched netlist.

*   **Improved Model & Path Management:**
    *   **Before:** Model paths might have been less flexible or prone to issues in different deployment environments. Docker configurations might have been less optimized.
    *   **After:**
        *   Enhanced the robustness of path handling for YOLO and SAM2 models, including specific adjustments for Ubuntu environments (e.g., providing correct SAM2 configuration paths for Hydra). (Corresponds to commit `81989c85`)
        *   Implemented checks at application startup for the existence of SAM2 model files, issuing warnings and gracefully disabling SAM2-dependent features if files are not found, preventing crashes.
        *   Updated and optimized Docker configurations for improved deployment, portability, and dependency management. (Corresponds to commits `2656fcb2`, `c48840df`)

*   **Enhanced Logging & Error Handling:**
    *   **Before:** Logging might have been sparse, and error handling less specific, making debugging difficult. Handling of problematic input files (missing, corrupt) could lead to ungraceful failures.
    *   **After:**
        *   Significantly increased the detail and coverage of logging throughout the application's lifecycle, providing better insight into the analysis process and potential issues.
        *   Implemented more robust error handling mechanisms during model loading and critical analysis steps.
        *   Improved the handling of edge cases such as missing input files or attempts to process corrupt images, ensuring the application fails more gracefully or provides informative error messages.
        *   *Note: Recent commits `0919b581` ("caption"), `a51ec07b` ("classes"), and `f268692e` ("44") likely contribute to these general stability and refinement improvements. Further details could be added if their specific impact is known.*
